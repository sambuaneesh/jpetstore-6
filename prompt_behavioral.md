Here are the possible behavioral diagrams for the JPetStore application.

### 1. Use Case Diagram

#### Rationale
A Use Case diagram provides a high-level, bird's-eye view of the system's functionality. It's essential for understanding the primary goals a user can achieve and how different system functions relate to each other. This diagram identifies the main actor (`User`) and the key interactions they can have with the JPetStore system, such as managing their account, browsing the catalog, and placing an order. It clarifies which actions require authentication (e.g., `Place Order` includes `Sign In`).

#### Mermaid Diagram
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -- Manages --> B((Manage Account));
    A -- Browses --> C((Browse Catalog));
    A -- Searches --> D((Search Catalog));
    A -- Manages --> E((Manage Cart));
    A -- Places --> F((Place Order));
    A -- Views --> G((View Orders));

    subgraph "Manage Account"
        B1((Register))
        B2((Sign In))
        B3((Sign Out))
        B4((Edit Profile))
    end
    
    B --- B1
    B --- B2
    B --- B3
    B --- B4

    F -- includes --> B2;
    G -- includes --> B2;
    B4 -- includes --> B2;
    E -- extends --> C;

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### 2. Sequence Diagrams

Sequence diagrams are perfect for illustrating how different components of the system collaborate over time to complete a specific task. They show the exact sequence of method calls and interactions between objects.

#### a. User Sign-In Sequence

**Rationale**
This diagram details the step-by-step process of a user signing in. It shows the flow of control from the web layer (`AccountActionBean`) to the service layer (`AccountService`) and finally to the data access layer (`AccountMapper`). This clearly visualizes the separation of concerns and how each layer contributes to authenticating the user and establishing a session.

**Mermaid Diagram**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant AAB as AccountActionBean
    participant AS as AccountService
    participant AM as AccountMapper
    participant DB as Database
    participant Session as HttpSession

    User->>AAB: Submits username & password
    activate AAB
    AAB->>AS: getAccount(username, password)
    activate AS
    AS->>AM: getAccountByUsernameAndPassword(...)
    activate AM
    AM->>DB: SELECT query on ACCOUNT, PROFILE, SIGNON
    activate DB
    DB-->>AM: Return Account Data
    deactivate DB
    AM-->>AS: Return Account object
    deactivate AM
    AS-->>AAB: Return Account object
    deactivate AS
    AAB->>Session: setAttribute("accountBean", this)
    activate Session
    deactivate Session
    AAB-->>User: Redirect to main page
    deactivate AAB
```

#### b. Add Item to Cart Sequence

**Rationale**
This diagram illustrates one of the most common e-commerce interactions. It shows the logic involved when a user adds an item to their shopping cart. Key steps like checking item availability (`isItemInStock`) and retrieving item details (`getItem`) are clearly shown, demonstrating the collaboration between the `CartActionBean`, `CatalogService`, and the underlying data mappers. The interaction with the `Cart` object, which is maintained in the user's session, is also highlighted.

**Mermaid Diagram**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant CAB as CartActionBean
    participant CS as CatalogService
    participant IM as ItemMapper
    participant DB as Database
    participant Cart as Cart (Session Object)

    User->>CAB: Clicks 'Add to Cart' for an item
    activate CAB
    CAB->>Cart: containsItemId(workingItemId)
    activate Cart
    Cart-->>CAB: false
    deactivate Cart
    
    CAB->>CS: isItemInStock(workingItemId)
    activate CS
    CS->>IM: getInventoryQuantity(itemId)
    activate IM
    IM->>DB: SELECT QTY FROM INVENTORY
    activate DB
    DB-->>IM: Return quantity
    deactivate DB
    IM-->>CS: Return quantity
    deactivate IM
    CS-->>CAB: true
    deactivate CS

    CAB->>CS: getItem(workingItemId)
    activate CS
    CS->>IM: getItem(itemId)
    activate IM
    IM->>DB: SELECT ... FROM ITEM, PRODUCT
    activate DB
    DB-->>IM: Return Item object
    deactivate DB
    IM-->>CS: Return Item object
    deactivate IM
    CS-->>CAB: Return Item object
    deactivate CS
    
    CAB->>Cart: addItem(item, isInStock)
    activate Cart
    Cart-->>CAB: Cart updated
    deactivate Cart
    
    CAB-->>User: Display updated Cart view
    deactivate CAB
```

#### c. Place Order Sequence

**Rationale**
The checkout process is the most critical workflow in an e-commerce application. This sequence diagram details the entire flow, from the user confirming their order to the system persisting it in the database. It effectively showcases the transactional nature of the `OrderService.insertOrder` method, where multiple database operations (getting a new order ID, updating inventory, inserting order and line items) must succeed or fail as a single unit.

**Mermaid Diagram**
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant OAB as OrderActionBean
    participant OS as OrderService
    participant OM as OrderMapper
    participant LIM as LineItemMapper
    participant IM as ItemMapper
    participant SM as SequenceMapper
    participant DB as Database

    User->>OAB: Confirms Order
    activate OAB
    OAB->>OS: insertOrder(order)
    activate OS

    OS->>SM: getSequence('ordernum')
    activate SM
    SM->>DB: SELECT nextid FROM SEQUENCE
    DB-->>SM: returns 1000
    deactivate SM
    
    OS->>SM: updateSequence(...)
    activate SM
    SM->>DB: UPDATE SEQUENCE SET nextid=1001
    deactivate SM
    
    loop for each LineItem in Order
        OS->>IM: updateInventoryQuantity(itemId, quantity)
        activate IM
        IM->>DB: UPDATE INVENTORY
        deactivate IM
    end
    
    OS->>OM: insertOrder(order)
    activate OM
    OM->>DB: INSERT INTO ORDERS
    deactivate OM
    
    OS->>OM: insertOrderStatus(order)
    activate OM
    OM->>DB: INSERT INTO ORDERSTATUS
    deactivate OM
    
    loop for each LineItem in Order
        OS->>LIM: insertLineItem(lineItem)
        activate LIM
        LIM->>DB: INSERT INTO LINEITEM
        deactivate LIM
    end

    OS-->>OAB: Order successfully inserted
    deactivate OS
    OAB-->>User: Display 'Thank You' page with Order Details
    deactivate OAB
```

### 3. Activity Diagram

#### Checkout Process Activity

**Rationale**
While a sequence diagram shows the interaction between objects, an activity diagram excels at modeling the flow of control in a complex process. This diagram visualizes the entire checkout workflow from the user's perspective. It clearly shows decision points (like checking for authentication or shipping to a different address) and the paths the user can take, making it easy to understand the overall business process.

**Mermaid Diagram**
```mermaid
graph TD
    start([Start]) --> viewCart{View Cart};
    viewCart --> clickCheckout[Click 'Proceed to Checkout'];
    clickCheckout --> isAuthenticated{Is User Authenticated?};
    
    isAuthenticated -- No --> signIn[Redirect to Sign In Page];
    signIn --> performSignIn[User Signs In];
    performSignIn --> isAuthenticated;

    isAuthenticated -- Yes --> enterBilling[Enter Billing & Payment Info];
    enterBilling --> differentShipping{Ship to different address?};
    
    differentShipping -- Yes --> enterShipping[Enter Shipping Info];
    enterShipping --> confirmOrder[Confirm Order Details];

    differentShipping -- No --> confirmOrder;
    
    confirmOrder --> submitOrder[Submit Order];
    submitOrder --> persistOrder[Service: Persist Order in DB];
    persistOrder --> clearCart[Service: Clear Cart];
    clearCart --> showSuccess[Show Success Page];
    showSuccess --> stop([End]);
```

***

### 4. State Machine Diagram

#### User Session State

**Rationale**
A state machine diagram is ideal for modeling the lifecycle of an object with distinct states. This diagram models the state of a user's session. A session can be in one of two primary states: `Unauthenticated` or `Authenticated`. The diagram shows the specific events (like `signon`, `signoff`, `newAccount`) that cause a transition from one state to another, providing a clear and concise model of user session management.

**Mermaid Diagram**
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unauthenticated

    state Unauthenticated {
        [*] --> NotLoggedIn
        NotLoggedIn --> Authenticated: signon(valid_credentials)
        NotLoggedIn --> Authenticated: newAccount(successful_registration)
    }

    state Authenticated {
        [*] --> LoggedIn
        LoggedIn --> LoggedIn: editAccount()
        LoggedIn --> Unauthenticated: signoff()
    }
```
