Overall Purpose and Role\n\nThe `org.mybatis.jpetstore.service` package serves as the **core business logic layer** for the JPetStore e-commerce application, implementing the service layer pattern to coordinate complex business operations and maintain transactional integrity across the system. This package acts as the central orchestration point between the presentation layer (controllers/UI) and data persistence layer (mappers/DAO), encapsulating the essential e-commerce workflows that drive the online pet store's operations.\n\n### 2. Inter-file Collaboration and Goal Achievement\n\nThe package achieves its objectives through a **coordinated triad of domain services** that work together to provide a complete e-commerce experience:\n\n- **AccountService** establishes the foundation by managing customer identity and authentication, enabling personalized shopping experiences\n- **CatalogService** builds upon this by providing product discovery and availability management, allowing authenticated users to browse and search inventory\n- **OrderService** completes the transaction lifecycle by processing purchases, managing inventory updates, and maintaining order history\n\nThe test files (`*Test.java`) ensure reliability through comprehensive validation of each service's integration with data mappers, maintaining data consistency across complex multi-table operations.\n\n### 3. Key Functionalities Provided\n\n**Customer Management:**\n- Secure user authentication and registration\n- Customer profile management and updates\n- Account lifecycle handling from creation to maintenance\n\n**Product Discovery:**\n- Category-based product browsing\n- Keyword search with partial matching\n- Product-item relationship mapping\n- Real-time inventory status verification\n\n**Order Processing:**\n- Transactional order creation with automatic ID generation\n- Inventory management and stock updates\n- Order history retrieval with complete item details\n- Line item persistence and management\n\n**Data Integrity:**\n- Coordinated multi-table operations across account, profile, authentication, orders, and inventory\n- Transactional consistency in order processing\n- Exception handling for business rule violations\n\n### 4. Notable Patterns and Architectural Decisions\n\n**Service Layer Pattern:** The package clearly implements the Service Layer pattern, abstracting complex business operations behind clean service interfaces that coordinate multiple data mappers.\n\n**Transaction Script Pattern:** Each service method encapsulates a complete business transaction (e.g., placing an order, updating account), handling all related persistence operations within a single transactional boundary.\n\n**Separation of Concerns:** Clear domain segmentation with dedicated services for Accounts, Catalog, and Orders, following domain-driven design principles.\n\n**Test-Driven Architecture:** Comprehensive test coverage with mocked dependencies demonstrates a commitment to reliability, particularly important for e-commerce transactions where data consistency is critical.\n\n**Persistence Abstraction:** Services coordinate multiple mappers (AccountMapper, ProductMapper, OrderMapper, etc.) but abstract the complexity from clients, providing a unified business operation interface.\n\n**Inventory-Aware Order Processing:** The OrderService demonstrates sophisticated inventory management by integrating stock checks and updates directly into the order creation workflow, preventing overselling scenarios common in e-commerce systems.\n\nThis package exemplifies a well-structured service layer that successfully balances business complexity with clean API design, providing the essential foundation for a reliable, scalable e-commerce platform.",
