| Component Name | Responsibility | Interfaces (key endpoints or methods) | Depends On | Technologies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web UI Layer (ActionBeans)** | Handles HTTP requests, manages user session and UI state (e.g., shopping cart), delegates to services, and selects JSP views for rendering. | URL Endpoints: `/actions/Catalog.action`, `/actions/Account.action`, `/actions/Cart.action`, `/actions/Order.action`. | `AccountService`, `CatalogService`, `OrderService`, `Domain Model (Cart)` | Stripes Framework, JSP, Spring DI (`@SpringBean`), MVC Pattern |
| **AccountService** | Manages user account lifecycle: registration, profile updates, and authentication details. Orchestrates transactional writes to account-related tables. | `getAccount(username)`, `insertAccount(account)`, `updateAccount(account)` | `AccountMapper`, `Domain Model (Account)` | Spring (`@Service`, `@Transactional`) |
| **CatalogService** | Provides a facade for browsing the product catalog, including categories, products, and items. Implements product search logic. | `getCategoryList()`, `getProductListByCategory(...)`, `getItem(...)`, `searchProductList(keywords)` | `CategoryMapper`, `ProductMapper`, `ItemMapper`, `Domain Model` | Spring (`@Service`) |
| **OrderService** | Manages the order placement workflow. Its primary method is a critical transaction that updates inventory, generates order IDs, and saves order details. | `insertOrder(order)`, `getOrder(orderId)`, `getNextId(name)` | `ItemMapper`, `OrderMapper`, `LineItemMapper`, `SequenceMapper`, `Domain Model (Order)` | Spring (`@Service`, `@Transactional`) |
| **Data Access Layer (Mappers)** | Defines contracts for database operations. Executes SQL queries to perform CRUD actions and maps database results to domain objects. | Mapper methods, e.g., `AccountMapper.getAccountByUsername`, `ItemMapper.updateInventoryQuantity`, `OrderMapper.insertOrder` | `Database (HSQLDB)`, `Domain Model` | MyBatis, MyBatis-Spring, SQL, Data Mapper Pattern |
| **Domain Model** | Represents the core business entities (POJOs) like Account, Product, Order, and Cart. Contains some in-memory logic (e.g., `Cart` calculations). | Public getters/setters on POJOs; methods like `Cart.addItem()`, `Cart.getSubTotal()` | (None - foundational component) | POJO |
| **Database** | Provides relational, persistent storage for all application data, including accounts, catalog, inventory, and orders. | SQL Interface (via JDBC driver) | (None - data source) | HSQLDB |
