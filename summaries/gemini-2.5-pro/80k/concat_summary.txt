An architectural summary of `mybatis-jpetstore-6` codebase chunk 1 of 2, prepared for microservice decomposition analysis.

### 1. Overall Architecture

The JPetStore application is a **monolithic, three-tier (layered) web application** designed as an online pet store. It is built using a classic Java stack. The architecture is tightly coupled, with components communicating via in-process method calls.

-   **Presentation Layer:** Implemented with **Stripes Framework** and **JSP** pages. Handles user interaction and web requests.
-   **Business Logic Layer:** Implemented with **Spring Framework** services. Encapsulates the core business rules.
-   **Data Access Layer:** Implemented with **MyBatis**, acting as a data mapper to an SQL database.

The application uses an embedded **HSQLDB** in-memory database, which is initialized with schema and data on startup.

### 2. Architectural Frameworks & Patterns

-   **Architectural Style:** Monolithic Layered Architecture.
-   **Key Patterns:**
    -   **Model-View-Controller (MVC):** Stripes `ActionBean`s act as Controllers, domain objects as the Model, and JSPs as the View.
    -   **Dependency Injection (DI):** The Spring Framework is used to manage the lifecycle of services and mappers and inject dependencies.
    -   **Data Mapper:** MyBatis is used to map Java objects to database tables without complex ORM features.
    -   **Transactional Service Layer:** Business logic methods in the service layer are annotated with `@Transactional` for declarative transaction management by Spring.
-   **Core Frameworks:**
    -   **Spring Framework:** Core for DI and transaction management.
    -   **MyBatis:** For database persistence.
    -   **Stripes Framework:** For the web/MVC layer.
    -   **HSQLDB:** Embedded SQL database.

### 3. Component Breakdown & Responsibilities

The application is structured into distinct packages, each with a clear responsibility.

#### 3.1. Domain Model (`org.mybatis.jpetstore.domain`)

These are simple POJOs representing the core business entities. They are used across all layers.
-   **`Account`**: Represents a user's account information, including credentials, profile, and address.
-   **`Category`**: Represents a category of pets (e.g., DOGS, CATS).
-   **`Product`**: Represents a specific type of pet within a category (e.g., Bulldog).
-   **`Item`**: A specific, sellable instance of a product (e.g., Male Adult Bulldog). Has price and inventory details.
-   **`Cart`**: A session-scoped object representing the user's shopping cart.
-   **`CartItem`**: An item within the `Cart`, linking to an `Item` and quantity.
-   **`Order`**: Represents a customer's order, containing billing/shipping details and line items.
-   **`LineItem`**: Represents a single line in an `Order`.
-   **`Sequence`**: A utility domain object for managing database sequence numbers (e.g., for order IDs).

#### 3.2. Data Access Layer (`org.mybatis.jpetstore.mapper`)

These are MyBatis mapper interfaces that define the contract for database operations. The SQL queries are defined in corresponding XML files.

-   **`AccountMapper`**: Manages persistence for `Account`, `Profile`, and `Signon` tables.
-   **`CategoryMapper`**: Retrieves category data.
-   **`ProductMapper`**: Retrieves product data, including searching.
-   **`ItemMapper`**: Retrieves item data and manages inventory quantity.
-   **`OrderMapper`**: Manages persistence for `Order` and `OrderStatus` tables.
-   **`LineItemMapper`**: Manages persistence for `LineItem`s associated with an order.
-   **`SequenceMapper`**: Retrieves and updates sequence numbers from the `Sequence` table.

#### 3.3. Business Logic Layer (`org.mybatis.jpetstore.service`)

These are Spring-managed transactional services that orchestrate data access and implement business logic.

-   **`AccountService`**: Handles user account management (get, insert, update). It orchestrates writes to `ACCOUNT`, `PROFILE`, and `SIGNON` tables within a single transaction.
-   **`CatalogService`**: Provides methods to browse the pet catalog (categories, products, items) and perform searches. It also checks for item stock.
-   **`OrderService`**: Manages order processing. Its `insertOrder` method is a critical transactional unit that:
    1.  Generates a new order ID.
    2.  Updates the inventory for each item in the order.
    3.  Inserts the main order record.
    4.  Inserts the order status record.
    5.  Inserts all line item records.

#### 3.4. Presentation Layer (`org.mybatis.jpetstore.web.actions`)

These are Stripes `ActionBean`s that handle HTTP requests, interact with the service layer, and forward to JSP views. They are session-scoped.

-   **`AccountActionBean`**: Manages user session, sign-on, sign-off, and account creation/editing. Holds the authenticated `Account` object in the session.
-   **`CatalogActionBean`**: Handles browsing of the catalog (main page, categories, products, items) and product searches.
-   **`CartActionBean`**: Manages the user's shopping cart, including adding/removing items and updating quantities. The `Cart` object is a field within this session-scoped bean.
-   **`OrderActionBean`**: Manages the checkout process, including creating new orders, viewing past orders, and handling shipping information.

### 4. API Endpoints & UI Interfaces

The application is not service-oriented; endpoints are URL patterns handled by the Stripes framework, which map to `ActionBean`s. The URL pattern is `*.action`.

-   **Entry Point**: `/index.html` -> redirects to `/actions/Catalog.action`.

-   **`CatalogActionBean` (`/actions/Catalog.action`)**:
    -   `viewMain` (default): Displays the main store page (`Main.jsp`).
    -   `viewCategory`: Displays all products in a category (`Category.jsp`).
    -   `viewProduct`: Displays all items for a product (`Product.jsp`).
    -   `viewItem`: Displays details for a single item (`Item.jsp`).
    -   `searchProducts`: Displays search results (`SearchProducts.jsp`).

-   **`AccountActionBean` (`/actions/Account.action`)**:
    -   `signonForm` (default): Shows the login form (`SignonForm.jsp`).
    -   `signon`: Processes login credentials.
    -   `signoff`: Invalidates the session and logs the user out.
    -   `newAccountForm`: Displays the registration form (`NewAccountForm.jsp`).
    -   `newAccount`: Processes new account registration.
    -   `editAccountForm`: Displays the account editing form (`EditAccountForm.jsp`).
    -   `editAccount`: Processes account updates.

-   **`CartActionBean` (`/actions/Cart.action`)**:
    -   `addItemToCart`: Adds an item to the cart and shows the cart (`Cart.jsp`).
    -   `removeItemFromCart`: Removes an item and shows the cart (`Cart.jsp`).
    -   `updateCartQuantities`: Updates quantities and shows the cart (`Cart.jsp`).
    -   `viewCart`: Displays the cart (`Cart.jsp`).
    -   `checkOut`: Displays the checkout summary page (`Checkout.jsp`).

-   **`OrderActionBean` (`/actions/Order.action`)**:
    -   `listOrders`: Shows the user's order history (`ListOrders.jsp`).
    -   `newOrderForm`: Displays the initial order form with billing details (`NewOrderForm.jsp`).
    -   `newOrder`: A multi-step method that coordinates the checkout process, displaying shipping/confirmation forms (`ShippingForm.jsp`, `ConfirmOrder.jsp`) before finally submitting the order and showing the result (`ViewOrder.jsp`).
    -   `viewOrder`: Displays the details of a specific order (`ViewOrder.jsp`).

### 5. Service Dependencies & Communication

Communication is synchronous and occurs via direct method invocation within the JVM.

-   **Presentation -> Business:** `ActionBean`s have `Service` instances injected by Stripes' Spring integration (`@SpringBean`). They call service methods to perform business operations.
-   **Business -> Data Access:** `Service`s have `Mapper` instances injected by Spring (`@Autowired`). They call mapper methods to interact with the database.
-   **Data Cohesion:** The three logical domains (`Account`, `Catalog`, `Order`) are tightly coupled.
    -   `AccountActionBean` depends on `AccountService` and `CatalogService` (to get the user's favorite category list).
    -   `OrderActionBean` depends on `OrderService` and interacts with `AccountActionBean` and `CartActionBean` via the HTTP session to get user and cart data.
    -   `OrderService` depends on `ItemMapper` (from the catalog domain) to update inventory, demonstrating a strong cross-domain dependency.

### 6. Database Schema & Data Models

The database is a relational SQL database (HSQLDB). The schema reveals the relationships between the core domain concepts.

#### 6.1. Database Schema (`jpetstore-hsqldb-schema.sql`)

-   **Account & Profile Tables:**
    -   `SIGNON`: `username` (PK), `password`
    -   `ACCOUNT`: `userid` (PK), `email`, `firstname`, `lastname`, address fields.
    -   `PROFILE`: `userid` (PK), `langpref`, `favcategory`, `mylistopt`, `banneropt`.
    -   `BANNERDATA`: `favcategory` (PK), `bannername`.
-   **Catalog & Inventory Tables:**
    -   `CATEGORY`: `catid` (PK), `name`, `descn`.
    -   `PRODUCT`: `productid` (PK), `category` (FK to CATEGORY), `name`, `descn`.
    -   `ITEM`: `itemid` (PK), `productid` (FK to PRODUCT), `listprice`, `unitcost`, `supplier` (FK to SUPPLIER), status, attributes.
    -   `INVENTORY`: `itemid` (PK), `qty`.
    -   `SUPPLIER`: `suppid` (PK), `name`, address fields.
-   **Order Tables:**
    -   `ORDERS`: `orderid` (PK), `userid`, `orderdate`, shipping/billing address fields, `totalprice`.
    -   `LINEITEM`: `orderid` (PK), `linenum` (PK), `itemid`, `quantity`, `unitprice`.
    -   `ORDERSTATUS`: `orderid` (PK), `linenum` (PK), `timestamp`, `status`.
-   **Utility Table:**
    -   `SEQUENCE`: `name` (PK), `nextid`. Used for generating order IDs.

#### 6.2. Data Models (Domain Objects)

The Java classes in `org.mybatis.jpetstore.domain` map directly to the database tables. MyBatis uses XML mappers to handle the mapping between object properties and table columns (e.g., `firstName` in `Account.java` maps to `FIRSTNAME` column in the `ACCOUNT` table).

### 7. Key Business Logic & Algorithms

-   **Order Placement (`OrderService.insertOrder`)**: This is the most critical business transaction. It ensures that inventory is updated and all order-related records (`ORDERS`, `ORDERSTATUS`, `LINEITEM`) are created atomically. Failure at any step results in a full rollback.
-   **Cart Calculation (`Cart.getSubTotal`)**: A simple calculation that iterates through `CartItem`s and computes the total price by multiplying item list price by quantity.
-   **Product Search (`CatalogService.searchProductList`)**: A basic search algorithm that splits the search string into keywords and performs a `LIKE` query for each keyword, aggregating the results.
-   **ID Generation (`OrderService.getNextId`)**: A transactional method to fetch and increment a sequence number from the `SEQUENCE` table to ensure unique order IDs.

### 8. Configuration & Deployment

-   **Build & Dependencies (`pom.xml`):**
    -   **Build Tool:** Apache Maven.
    -   **Packaging:** `war` (Web Application Archive).
    -   **Key Dependencies:** `mybatis`, `mybatis-spring`, `spring-context`, `spring-jdbc`, `stripes`, `hsqldb`, `jakarta.servlet-api`.
-   **Application Configuration:**
    -   **`web.xml`:** The web deployment descriptor. It configures the Spring `ContextLoaderListener` to bootstrap the application context and the `StripesFilter`/`DispatcherServlet` to handle web requests.
    -   **`applicationContext.xml`:** The Spring configuration file. It defines:
        -   The embedded HSQLDB `dataSource`.
        -   The `DataSourceTransactionManager` for transaction management.
        -   Component scanning for the `service` package.
        -   The MyBatis `SqlSessionFactoryBean`.
        -   MyBatis mapper scanning for the `mapper` package.
-   **Deployment Environment:**
    -   **Application Server:** Designed to run on any Java EE compliant web container (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty), managed by the **Cargo Maven Plugin** for local execution.
    -   **Containerization:** A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yaml` are provided to build and run the application in a Docker container. The Dockerfile uses a multi-stage process to build the application with Maven and run it on Tomcat.

=== summary_chunk_2.txt ===

This document provides a comprehensive architectural summary of the JPetStore 6 application, focusing on details relevant to microservice decomposition analysis.

### 1. Overall Architecture & Key Frameworks

The JPetStore 6 application is a monolithic, multi-layered web application built using a classic Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.

*   **Architectural Pattern:** 3-tier MVC architecture.
    *   **Presentation Layer:** Handles user interaction and rendering.
    *   **Service (Logic) Layer:** Encapsulates business logic and orchestrates data operations.
    *   **Persistence (Data Access) Layer:** Manages data interaction with the database.
*   **Key Frameworks:**
    *   **Spring Framework (v4):** Used for Dependency Injection (DI), component scanning, and declarative transaction management. It forms the core of the application's backend.
    *   **MyBatis (v3) with MyBatis-Spring:** Provides the data mapping and persistence layer, connecting Java objects to SQL statements.
    *   **Stripes Framework:** A Java web framework used for the presentation layer (MVC's Controller and View components). It handles request dispatching and UI logic.
*   **Application Type:** Standard Java web application packaged as a WAR file, designed to run on any Servlet 2.5 / JSP 2.1 compliant server (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty, Wildfly).

### 2. Component Names and Responsibilities

The application is structured into distinct packages, each with a clear responsibility.

#### 2.1. Presentation Layer (`org.mybatis.jpetstore.web`)

*   **Component Type:** Stripes `ActionBean`s (similar to Spring MVC Controllers).
*   **Responsibility:** Handle incoming HTTP requests, interact with the service layer to perform business operations, and forward to JSP pages for rendering the response.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `AccountActionBean`: Manages user authentication (sign-on), registration (new account), and profile updates (edit account). Holds session state for the logged-in user.
    *   `CatalogActionBean`: Handles all catalog browsing functionality, including viewing categories, products, items, and searching.
    *   `CartActionBean`: Manages the user's shopping cart. Logic includes adding/removing items, updating quantities, and viewing the cart.
    *   `OrderActionBean`: Manages the order placement workflow, including viewing past orders, creating new orders, and confirming them.
*   **Dependencies:** ActionBeans depend on Service layer components, which are injected by Stripes' `SpringInterceptor` using the `@SpringBean` annotation.

#### 2.2. Service (Logic) Layer (`org.mybatis.jpetstore.service`)

*   **Component Type:** Spring Services (`@Service`).
*   **Responsibility:** Implements the core business logic. Acts as a transactional boundary and decouples the presentation layer from the persistence layer.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `AccountService`: Provides methods for user account management (`insertAccount`, `updateAccount`, `getAccount`). It orchestrates writes to the `account`, `profile`, and `signon` tables.
    *   `CatalogService`: Provides methods for accessing the product catalog (`getCategoryList`, `getProductListByCategory`, `getItem`, `searchProductList`). It acts as a facade over the various catalog-related mappers.
    *   `OrderService`: Manages order processing. Its `insertOrder` method is a key transactional operation that updates inventory, creates an order, and saves line items. It also handles generating unique order IDs.
*   **Dependencies:** Services depend on Mapper interfaces, which are injected by Spring using `@Autowired`.

#### 2.3. Persistence Layer (`org.mybatis.jpetstore.mapper`)

*   **Component Type:** MyBatis Mapper interfaces and corresponding XML files.
*   **Responsibility:** Defines and executes SQL statements to interact with the database. These interfaces are the sole point of contact with the database. No JDBC or MyBatis API calls are made in the service layer.
*   **Key Components (Interfaces):**
    *   `AccountMapper`: Handles CRUD operations for `Account`, `Profile`, and `Signon` data.
    *   `CategoryMapper`: Fetches product category data.
    *   `ProductMapper`: Fetches product data, including searching.
    *   `ItemMapper`: Fetches item-specific data (variants of products) and manages inventory levels.
    *   `OrderMapper`: Handles CRUD operations for `Order` and `OrderStatus` data.
    *   `LineItemMapper`: Handles CRUD operations for `LineItem` data (items within an order).
    *   `SequenceMapper`: Manages a sequence table to generate unique IDs (e.g., for orders).

#### 2.4. Domain Model (`org.mybatis.jpetstore.domain`)

*   **Component Type:** Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs).
*   **Responsibility:** Represent the core business entities of the application.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   `Account`: Represents a user's account information.
    *   `Product`, `Category`, `Item`: Represent the product catalog hierarchy.
    *   `Cart`, `CartItem`: Represent the in-memory shopping cart. `Cart` contains business logic for item management and subtotal calculation.
    *   `Order`, `LineItem`: Represent a customer's order and its contents. `Order` contains logic to initialize itself from an `Account` and `Cart`.

### 3. API Endpoints and Interfaces

*   **External API:** The application exposes a web UI, not a REST API. Endpoints are defined by the Stripes framework, mapping URLs ending in `*.action` to methods within the `ActionBean` classes. For example, a request to `viewCategory.action` would be handled by a method like `viewCategory()` in one of the `ActionBean`s.
*   **Internal Interfaces:**
    *   **Service Interfaces:** While the sample implementation uses concrete service classes, these define the contract between the presentation and logic layers.
    *   **Mapper Interfaces:** These are the primary internal interfaces, defining the contract for all database operations. The implementation is provided by MyBatis at runtime based on the corresponding XML mapping files.

### 4. Database Schema and Data Models

The database schema is defined in `jpetstore-hsqldb-schema.sql` and populated by `jpetstore-hsqldb-dataload.sql`. The tests confirm the existence and relationships of the following tables:

*   **`SIGNON`**: User credentials (`USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`).
*   **`ACCOUNT`**: User personal information (`USERID`, `EMAIL`, `FIRSTNAME`, `LASTNAME`, address details).
*   **`PROFILE`**: User preferences (`USERID`, `LANGPREF`, `FAVCATEGORY`).
*   **`CATEGORY`**: Product categories (`CATID`, `NAME`, `DESCN`).
*   **`PRODUCT`**: Products within a category (`PRODUCTID`, `CATEGORY`, `NAME`, `DESCN`).
*   **`ITEM`**: Specific items/variants of a product (`ITEMID`, `PRODUCTID`, `LISTPRICE`, attributes).
*   **`INVENTORY`**: Stock quantity for items (`ITEMID`, `QTY`).
*   **`ORDERS`**: Order header information (`ORDERID`, `USERID`, shipping/billing details, `TOTALPRICE`).
*   **`ORDERSTATUS`**: Status of an order (`ORDERID`, `STATUS`, `TIMESTAMP`).
*   **`LINEITEM`**: Individual items within an order (`ORDERID`, `LINENUM`, `ITEMID`, `QUANTITY`, `UNITPRICE`).
*   **`SEQUENCE`**: Used for generating primary keys (`NAME`, `NEXTID`).

### 5. Service Dependencies and Communication Patterns

*   **Pattern:** Dependency Injection is used throughout. Communication is strictly layered.
*   **Flow:**
    1.  A user request hits a URL (`*.action`).
    2.  The Stripes `DispatcherServlet` routes the request to the appropriate `ActionBean`.
    3.  The `ActionBean` calls methods on a Service class (injected via `@SpringBean`).
    4.  The Service class executes business logic. For data operations, it calls methods on one or more Mapper interfaces (injected via `@Autowired`).
    5.  Spring's transaction manager (`@Transactional`) wraps the service method call, ensuring atomicity for database operations spanning multiple mappers (e.g., `OrderService.insertOrder`).
    6.  MyBatis executes the SQL defined in the Mapper XML, maps the results to Domain objects, and returns them up the call stack.
    7.  The `ActionBean` receives the result, sets data in the request scope, and forwards to a JSP for rendering.

*   **Key Dependency Graph (Service -> Mappers):**
    *   `AccountService` -> `AccountMapper`
    *   `CatalogService` -> `CategoryMapper`, `ProductMapper`, `ItemMapper`
    *   `OrderService` -> `OrderMapper`, `LineItemMapper`, `ItemMapper`, `SequenceMapper`

### 6. Key Business Logic and Algorithms

*   **User Registration:** (`AccountService.insertAccount`) A single operation that creates records in `ACCOUNT`, `PROFILE`, and `SIGNON` tables.
*   **Product Search:** (`CatalogService.searchProductList`) The logic splits the search string by spaces and performs a separate database query (with `LIKE`) for each token, combining the results.
*   **Order Placement:** (`OrderService.insertOrder`) This is the most critical transactional method.
    1.  Gets the next unique order ID from the `SEQUENCE` table (`getNextId`).
    2.  Iterates through `LineItem`s in the `Order` object.
    3.  For each `LineItem`, it calls `ItemMapper.updateInventoryQuantity` to decrement the stock level.
    4.  Calls `OrderMapper.insertOrder` to save the main order details.
    5.  Calls `OrderMapper.insertOrderStatus` to set the initial order status.
    6.  Iterates through `LineItem`s again to call `LineItemMapper.insertLineItem` to save them.
    *   The entire method is wrapped in a Spring `@Transactional` annotation, ensuring that all these database updates succeed or fail together.
*   **Shopping Cart Management:** (`Cart` domain object) All cart logic (add, remove, update, calculate total) is handled in-memory within the `Cart` object, which is stored in the user's HTTP session.

### 7. Configuration and Deployment Details

*   **Configuration Files:**
    *   `web.xml`: Configures the Stripes `StripesFilter` and `DispatcherServlet` to handle `*.action` requests. It also configures the Spring `ContextLoaderListener`, which bootstraps the Spring Application Context. It uses an `Interceptor` (`SpringInterceptor`) to enable DI into Stripes `ActionBean`s.
    *   `applicationContext.xml`: The core Spring configuration file.
        *   `<context:component-scan>` enables annotation-based configuration for services in `org.mybatis.jpetstore.service`.
        *   `<jdbc:embedded-database>` configures an in-memory HSQLDB for the demo, running schema and data load scripts on startup.
        *   `<bean id="transactionManager">` defines the `DataSourceTransactionManager` for declarative transactions.
        *   `<bean id="sqlSessionFactory">` configures the MyBatis `SqlSessionFactoryBean`, linking it to the `dataSource` and setting the package for type aliases (`org.mybatis.jpetstore.domain`).
        *   `<mybatis:scan>` tells MyBatis-Spring to scan for Mapper interfaces in `org.mybatis.jpetstore.mapper`.
*   **Deployment:**
    *   The application is built using Maven.
    *   The CI/CD pipelines (`.github/workflows/`) automate testing, code analysis (CodeQL, SonarCloud), coverage reporting (Coveralls), and deployment to Sonatype (Maven Central).
    *   The `support.yaml` workflow demonstrates that the application is tested for deployment across a variety of standard Java application servers (Tomcat, Wildfly, Jetty, etc.), confirming its nature as a standard WAR deployment.
