| Component Name | Responsibility | Interfaces (key endpoints or methods) | Depends On (other modules) | Technologies (frameworks, DBs, patterns) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Controller Layer** | Handles incoming HTTP requests, orchestrates user interaction flows, invokes business services, and resolves to the appropriate view (JSP). | `AccountActionBean`, `CatalogActionBean`, `CartActionBean`, `OrderActionBean` and their event handler methods (e.g., `signon()`, `viewCategory()`, `addItemToCart()`, `newOrder()`). | Business Service Layer, Domain Model | Stripes (MVC Framework), JSP, MVC Pattern, ActionBean Pattern |
| **Business Service Layer** | Encapsulates core business logic, provides a high-level API to the presentation layer, applies business rules, and manages transactional boundaries. | `AccountService.getAccount()`, `CatalogService.getProductListByCategory()`, `OrderService.insertOrder()`, `CatalogService.searchProductList()`. | Persistence Layer, Domain Model | Spring (Dependency Injection), Service Layer Pattern, Façade Pattern, Domain-Driven Design (Implicit) |
| **Domain Model** | Defines the core business entities (POJOs) like Account, Product, and Order. Serves as the foundational data model for the entire application. | `Account.java`, `Product.java`, `Item.java`, `Cart.java`, `Order.java`, `LineItem.java`, and their respective getters/setters. | (Largely self-contained) | POJOs, `java.io.Serializable`, `java.math.BigDecimal` (for currency), Domain Model Pattern |
| **Persistence Layer** | Abstracts all database interactions, defining Data Access Object (DAO) contracts for CRUD operations on domain entities. | `AccountMapper.getAccountByUsername()`, `ProductMapper.getProductListByCategory()`, `OrderMapper.insertOrder()`, `ItemMapper.updateInventoryQuantity()`. | Domain Model | MyBatis, HSQLDB (for testing), Spring (for test context), JDBC, Data Access Object (DAO) Pattern |
| **UI Integration Test Suite** | Validates end-to-end user journeys and the cohesive functionality of the entire application stack from the user interface down to the database. | `ScreenTransitionIT` test methods that simulate user flows like registration, browsing, adding to cart, and checkout. | Web Controller Layer (via HTTP), Persistence Layer (for verification) | JUnit (implied), UI Automation Frameworks (e.g., Selenium, implied), End-to-End Testing Pattern |
| **Build & Development Support** | Standardizes the build process by managing the Apache Maven Wrapper, ensuring consistent tooling across all development and CI/CD environments. | `MavenWrapperDownloader.main()` command-line utility. | (Standalone utility) | Apache Maven Wrapper, Java (Standalone CLI utility), Build Automation |
