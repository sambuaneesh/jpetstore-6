| Component Name | Language | Frameworks | Database | Communication | Patterns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Web/Presentation (Stripes ActionBeans + JSPs) | Java, JSP | Stripes MVC 1.6, JSP, JSTL, Servlet API 4.0, Stripes–Spring integration | N/A (access via services) | HTTP (DispatcherServlet mapped to *.action); in-process calls to Spring services | MVC (action-based), Front Controller, Session-scoped controllers, Server-side rendering |
| Account Service | Java | Spring Framework (DI, @Service, @Transactional), mybatis-spring | HSQLDB (ACCOUNT, PROFILE, SIGNON, BANNERDATA) | In-process method calls to MyBatis mappers; Spring-managed transactions | Service Layer, Transaction Script, DAO/Mapper |
| Catalog Service | Java | Spring Framework (DI, @Service), mybatis-spring | HSQLDB (CATEGORY, PRODUCT, ITEM, INVENTORY) | In-process calls to Category/Product/Item mappers; read-mostly | Service Layer, Transaction Script (read-oriented), DAO/Mapper |
| Order Service | Java | Spring Framework (DI, @Service, @Transactional), mybatis-spring | HSQLDB (ORDERS, ORDERSTATUS, LINEITEM, INVENTORY, SEQUENCE) | In-process calls to Order/LineItem/Item/Sequence mappers; single DB transaction per order | Service Layer, Transaction Script, Orchestration (inventory decrement + persistence), Table-based ID sequencing |
| Persistence Layer (MyBatis Mappers) | Java, SQL (XML mappers) | MyBatis 3.5.x, mybatis-spring 3.0.x | HSQLDB (entire schema) | JDBC via MyBatis SqlSession; per-mapper second-level cache | Data Mapper, DAO, Repository-like mappers, Second-level cache |
| ID Generation (Sequence subsystem) | Java, SQL | MyBatis (SequenceMapper), Spring Tx | HSQLDB (SEQUENCE table) | In-process select-then-update on SEQUENCE via JDBC/MyBatis | Table-based sequence, Non-atomic select+update (no DB sequence), Shared counter |
| Cart (Session Shopping Cart) | Java | None (plain POJOs) | N/A | In-process/session memory; used by ActionBeans and Order.initOrder | Session state, Aggregate/Entity + Value Objects, Calculation (subtotal) |
| Database | SQL | HSQLDB (embedded, in-memory) | HSQLDB | N/A (consumed via JDBC/MyBatis) | Relational schema, Table-per-entity, Denormalized FKs in places, Sequence table for IDs |
